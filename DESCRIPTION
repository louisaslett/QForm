Description: Provides upper and lower bounds on p-values for test statistics of the form \dqen{\sum\limits_i f\left(\lambda_i\right) \left(Z_i + \delta_i)^2}{\Sigma f( \lambda_i ) (Z_i + \delta_i)^2}. upper and lower bounds on the tail probabilities of quadratic forms in Gaussians.  These bounds CDF/PDF is obtained via the FFT based on the same transform as Davies' method. \deqn{(A,B) = (Q S Z^H, Q T Z^H)}{(A,B) = (Q*S*Z^H, Q*T*Z^H)}
