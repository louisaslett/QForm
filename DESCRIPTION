Description: Provides methods for screening with test statistics of the form. upper and lower bounds on the tail probabilities of quadratic forms in Gaussians.  These bounds CDF/PDF is obtained via the FFT based on the same transform as Davies' method. \deqn{(A,B) = (Q S Z^H, Q T Z^H)}{(A,B) = (Q*S*Z^H, Q*T*Z^H)}
